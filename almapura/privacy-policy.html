    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>We at AlmaPura are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy describes what data is collected, how it is used, and the user's rights regarding the collected data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The AlmaPura app does not collect any personal data directly from the user. However, the subscription model requires collecting certain information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Apple App Store and Google Play Store may collect data as described in their respective policies.</li>
        <li>Our backend service collects user and device IDs (which are not linked to the user's true identity) and purchase history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The collected data is used solely to manage subscriptions and maintain the functionality of the app. No personal data is used for marketing or sold to third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion Requests</h2>
    <p>You can request deletion of your data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:almapura@gandg.art">almapura@gandg.art</a>. Please note that user and device IDs, and recent purchase data cannot be deleted unless you choose to terminate your subscription immediately.</p>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All other data, which is not mentioned under the "Data Collection" section, is stored locally on the user's device. 
If the user enable backup services provided by third parties (such as iCloud or Google Drive), the information may be stored according to the privacy policies of those services. We do not provide any backup service nor have access to the data stored there.</p>

    <h2>Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices or legal requirements. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
